# scp-qt
a ssh sftp client written using Qt5 and python3 for transferring files between systems



WARNING:
	rsa key from openssh (as generated by `ssh-keygen` fails due to incompatibility/lack of support by paramiko
	if a workaround is found, I will implement it.

	instead use `ssh-keygen -t ed25519`
	id_ed25519 -- works great;

if you wish to edit the ui template files you will also need Qt Designer installed
